## Customer Churn Prediction

> This Data science project is about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning". (This project and the data was taken from this [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/customer-churn-prediction-2020))

> In this project I used some Machine Learning techniques and explored the data a little, so that in the end I could find the best possible algorithm with the best result.
